# Sanremo-wordclouds

The repository contains a Jupyter notebook that creates word clouds of the songs performed at 2021 Sanremo Music Festival.
Txt files contain the songs' lyrics. Png files contain handmade masks that I used to make the word clouds.
You can see my wordclouds at https://tuberi.medium.com/le-parole-di-sanremo-2021-9693fc77fdb1 .
